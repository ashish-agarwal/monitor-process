# Monitoring


## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest packages installed

```
npm install
cd public
bower install
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, make sure you have
[node](http://nodejs.com) installed. If you don't have bower,
`npm install -g bower`.

## Running the server

You can run your app using `npm start`. This will start a
server on `localhost:3000`. Currently I am listening to localhost:3001-5. You might have to start those too to see the output.
